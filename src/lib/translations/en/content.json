This allows us to calculate the similarity between recipes using mathematical operations.\n\nWhen you click on a recipe, we calculate the cosine similarity between your current vector and the recipe's vector. We then move your vector in the direction of the recipe's vector, so that the next recipe you see is more similar to the one you just clicked.",
